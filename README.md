# Rename-Images

Rename Images is a Python script to efficiently rename all files in the current folder on macOS in ascending order. The script will prefix the files with "IMG_" followed by a three-digit number (e.g., IMG_001, IMG_002, IMG_003, ...).

# How to Use

1) Save the script.py file in the folder containing the files you want to rename.
2) Run the script using the following command: python3 script.py
